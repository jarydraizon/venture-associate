The error message you're encountering, "Unexpected token 'P', "Proxy erro"... is not valid JSON", indicates that the response from your server is not valid JSON, likely due to a proxy error or an issue with your Express server error handling.

Suggested Steps to Resolve:
Check Error Handling in Server: First, ensure that your server properly sends JSON responses in case of errors. In your src/api/auth.js, modify the error handling to return JSON:

router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  if (!email || !password) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password are required' });
  }
  try {
    // Your existing code
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Signup error:', err.message); // Log the error for debugging
    return res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      error: err.message || 'Failed to create account'
    });
  }
});
Inspect Network Responses: Use the developer tools in your browser to inspect the network responses for the signup request. Look for the actual content being returned from the server. This may provide more insight into what the error message is.

Check Proxy Configuration: Since you are using the proxy setting in your package.json, make sure that requests are being routed correctly to your Express server running on port 3001. The defined proxy in package.json should ensure that all API requests are forwarded appropriately.

Update Environment Configurations: Ensure that your .env file includes all necessary environment variables, especially the JWT_SECRET for similar tasks. If this variable is missing, it could lead to problems when handling authentication tokens.

Re-run Your Server: After making changes, donâ€™t forget to stop and restart your server. Click the "Run" button in Replit to see if the changes help resolve the issue.

These steps should help in identifying the source of the error and ensuring that a valid JSON response is provided. If the problem persists, further debugging may be needed, such as logging the error stack to see what might be going wrong with your database operations or any missing configurations.
